## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of Whack-a-mole is to provide a fun, child friendly game to entertain it's users.
It has two target audiences: School aged children 5 to 13 and their parents. 

#### Player goals

The target audience for this game is children aged 5 to 13 years old.

Players goals are:
- A fun game to play.
- Child friendly controls.
- All controls laid out intuitively. 
- Entertaining images and sound with a rewarding experience when improvements are made.

Whack-a-mole meets these needs because:
- The design is visually appealing, using these user goals as design parameters.
- Controls are logically grouped, large and the use is easily interpreted.
- Colors lean towards the primary and are therefore stimulating and icons are simple and clear. 
- Audio is not overbearing, yet provides an additional reward for successful game play.

#### Parental goals

Parents are concerned about the amount of time children can spend playing computer games and want to be able to control 
identification and saving of information their child might enter into a website. 

Parent's goals are:
- Ability to reset or delete a stored player profile.
- A fun, well-functioning game that can be extended in its' use so additional games don't need to be purchased. 
- The ability to limit the time spent to finish a game.

Whack-a-mole meets these needs by:
- There is a reset data option that is easy to operate. 
- The game includes 3 levels of difficulty (slow, med, fast) and will store high scores if desired.
- Each game is timed for 30 seconds.

#### Developer and Business Goals

- An appealing and functional website that works as expected and provides a rewarding, fun experience for the user.
- An educational experience in the development of an interactive website using Javascript.
- A valuable example for the developers portfolio.

#### User Stories

As a player aged between 5-13 years old, I want:
1. Easily understood and operated controls.
2. Responsive and functional on all devices.
3. Feedback to know when I have been successful or not.
4. An ability to increase the challenge when my abilities improve.
5. Positive feedback when I hit a new high score.
6. Appealing icons and images that I can understand.
7. The ability to save high scores, so I can try to beat them.

As a parent of a player, I want:
1. Levels of difficulty choose from. 
2. An appealing game, so that my child and I can have a positive experience when using it.
3. The ability to easily remove a stored profile.
6. To know who developed the game and to be able to contact them easily.
